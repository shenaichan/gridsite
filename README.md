This is my new site!

I spent a while watching Jen Simmons' CSS talks and combing through
her various web experiments and was really inspired to up my
layout game. A few key points of inspiration:

- The web is a design exercise in verticality:

I built the site with React, Typescript, and HTML/CSS, though the bulk of the
work was translating my Figma mocks to CSS. I'm also using Next.js, which is
admittedly overkill at this point, but I'm excited for the site to ultimately
become a sprawling city of subpages, so I wanted that wiggle room from the getgo!
